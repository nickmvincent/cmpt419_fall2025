# Assignments

## Assignment 1

Fall 2025 Deadline: Sep 28 11:59pm.

You will submit a short report on tool-related exploration as your first "coding assignment" and do a short coding exercise.

This assignment is very flexible to accomodate for many different backgrounds. You should pick an option that's useful for you to get yourself ready to go in this class.

First everyone should answer the following questions, and submit via Canvas a report which describes your answers. You can submit as a PDF file or in plaintext as a .md file. Please organize your answers in terms of question numbers, as indicated below. It’s perfectly OK if some of your answers are very short!

Your choices are not binding -- this primarily to get you thinking about these choices early on and to encourage you to explore some of the available options before additional assignments are due.

Q1: Which tools you plan to use for writing code (IDE, AI assistance, version control). e.g. answers might include: VS Code, Sublime text, ChatGPT, Copilot, GitHub

Q2: What open questions or concerns do you have about code writing tools?

Q3: Which ML libraries / frameworks / tools do you have familiarity with already?

Q4: If given the choice, which ML libraries do you prefer to use for any assignments that involve training and evaluating a ML model?

Q5: Which ML libraries / frameworks / tools do you hope to learn more about (“I’m not sure, that’s why I’m taking this class” is an OK answer!)

Q6: Which tools you plan to use to read and take notes on papers, if any (pen + paper or PDF reader + notes app is perfectly fine answer!)

Q7: Which tools, if any, you plan to use for project management?

Next, you should complete one "speedrun" modeling project. You can adjust the difficulty for this, but it should involve loading a dataset, creating a test set, experimenting with more than one modeling approach, and printing more than performance metric with at least 2 presentation modalities (confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, etc.).

If you're new to using Python, you just use the pre-loaded "iris" dataset. If you're a veteran, you might use this as an opportunity to try to "speedrun" a decent baseline for a Kaggle competition.

You should submit one code file (PDF output, .ipynb, .py; if other format, such as using R or Jupypter, include a note.)

Basically, your goal here is to make sure you are able to very quickly produce a "simple baseline" for a classification task from a blank notebook or repo (your code).

To earn the marks, just hit the above requirements: load, split, multiple models, multiple metrics, multiple presentation modalities.

Anything else you want to add is extra!

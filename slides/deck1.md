# Reading Components

---

# Reading Structure

- **Mandatory Readings**: Core course material, weekly responses required  
- **Optional Readings**: Theme-organized, abstracts/intros, based on interests  

> Note: AI assistance discouraged for reading responses. I prefer bullet points over LLM-generated text!

# Reading Schedule

**Timeline**  
- Finalized Monday of Week X-1  
- Complete by Monday of Week X  
- Responses due before class

# Grading Structure


- "Reading Responses" : 10
- "Coding Assignments" : 20
- "Quizzes" : 20
- "Final Project" : 50

---

# Detailed Version

- 10% reading responses (12 total, drop lowest 2 using Canvas, so each of your top 10 responses effectively is worth 1%)
- 20% coding assignments (4 total; 5/5/5/5, drop lowest 1 using Canvas, so each of your top 3 assignments effectively is worth 6.6.67%)
- 20% quizzes (2 total; 10/10; may adjust scoresfor difficulty)
- 50% final project (5% project proposal, 45% actual project; must submit a written document and a presentation for both)

# Course FAQs

---

# Attendance

* Not directly graded
* Participation expected
* (Maybe) Cold-calling for reading responses
* Stay home when sick
* No need to email for absences

---

# Coding & Tools

FLEXIBLE.

* Python for ML/Data Science
* JavaScript for web programming
* LLM assistance allowed (with caveats)
* Free tools always available
* 4 assignments + 1 project

---

# Group Work Policy

* Some opportunities available. Generally **optional**
* Contribution statements required
* Code/writing review mandatory
* Guidelines per assignment

---

# Assessment Structure

* Likely TWO quizzes
* No midterm/final
* In-class format
* Make-up options available
* Based on lectures & readings

---

# AI Tool Usage

**Allowed with:** Logs, attribution, documentation

**Example citations:**

* Produced by model XYZ
* Generated with ChatGPT
* AI-assisted, heavily edited

---

# Example

I generated this deck by first manually writing a draft of the syllabus as `syllabus.md`, then asked Claude to style it.

---

# Agenda (if time)

* More details about modules
* Loose prerequisites & crash course
* Finding research papers
* Managing references & notes

---

# Module 1: Intro

Goals:

* Exposure to human/data-centric AI frameworks
* Learn frameworks aimed at researchers/designers
* Key question:

  > When would a human- or data-centric approach change your AI product?

---

# Frameworks We’ll See

* Human-Centered ML (Chancellor)
* DataPerf (data-centric AI)
* HCAI (Schneiderman)
* Value Sensitive Algorithm Design (Zhu)
* FairML
* "Public AI" (some of my work!)
* More to come!

---

# Module 1 Learning Goals

* Identify similarities/differences between approaches
* Apply concepts to scenarios (e.g., product design)

---

# Module 2: Technical work in data valuation, data scaling, and algorithmic collective action

* Data influence: Effect of each observation
* Scaling: Predict performance vs. dataset size
* Core idea: Reason about **data counterfactuals**. And social implications!

---

# Data Valuation Key Reading

> Hammoudeh & Lowd (2024) Training data influence analysis and estimation: A survey

---

# Data Scaling Key Readings

> Hestness et al. (2017) Deep learning scaling is predictable
> Villalobos et al. (2024) Will we run out of data?

---

# Why Focus on Data?

* Some HCAI work doesn’t focus on data
* Legislation, licensing, behavior change
* We’ll focus more on data levers (everyone is a data creator!)

---

# Module 2 Learning Goals

* Explain influence calculation & applications
* Describe scaling patterns
* Interpret scaling plots
* New forms of collective action

---

# Module 3: Platforms & Content

* Peer production (Wikipedia, Linux)
* "User-generated content"
* Quantitative reasoning about "content ecosystems"

---

# Module 4: Frontiers in Data Governance

* Overlap: Governing, markets, ecosystems
* Protocols for dataset maintenance
* Opt-in/out policies
* Platform governance
* Public interest AI

---

# Voting & Markets

* Vote with/for data
* Market conditions change counterfactuals

---

If time:

- In-person and/or Google doc "interest formation" network

# Week 1, Day 2: Course Overview

Press <kbd>Space</kbd> for next slide

---

# Agenda

* More details about modules
* Loose prerequisites & crash course
* Finding research papers
* Managing references & notes

---

# Module 1: Intro

Goals:

* Exposure to human/data-centric AI frameworks
* Learn frameworks aimed at researchers/designers
* Key question:

  > When would a human- or data-centric approach change your AI product?

---

# Frameworks We’ll See

* Human-Centered ML (Chancellor)
* DataPerf (data-centric AI)
* HCAI (Schneiderman)
* Value Sensitive Algorithm Design (Zhu)
* FairML
* More to come!

---

# Module 1 Learning Goals

* Identify similarities/differences between approaches
* Apply concepts to scenarios (e.g., product design)

---

# Module 2: Data Valuation & Scaling

* Data influence: Effect of each observation
* Scaling: Predict performance vs. dataset size
* Core idea: Reason about **data counterfactuals**

---

# Data Valuation Key Reading

> Hammoudeh & Lowd (2024) Training data influence analysis and estimation: A survey

---

# Data Scaling Key Readings

> Hestness et al. (2017) Deep learning scaling is predictable
> Villalobos et al. (2024) Will we run out of data?

---

# Why Focus on Data?

* Some HCAI work doesn’t focus on data
* Legislation, licensing, behavior change
* We’ll focus more on data levers (everyone is a data creator!)

---

# Module 2 Learning Goals

* Explain influence calculation & applications
* Describe scaling patterns
* Interpret scaling plots

---

# Module 3: Platforms & Content

* Peer production (Wikipedia, Linux)
* UGC platforms: Flickr, Twitter, TikTok
* Quantitative reasoning about ecosystems

---

# Module 4: Data Governance

* Overlap: Governing, markets, ecosystems
* Protocols for dataset maintenance
* Opt-in/out policies
* Platform governance

---

# Voting & Markets

* Vote with/for data
* Market conditions change counterfactuals

---

If time:

- In-person and/or Google doc "interest formation" network
